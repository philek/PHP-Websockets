clietnsocket.php:258 - Move checking for GET request outside of loop only on first line.
clietnsocket.php:271 - Move verifying existance GET along with above



TODO and possible ideas:
- Create a "HandshakeResponse" class for more readability.
- Move all frame parsing to an InboundMessageBuilder class
- Move frame building to a better location. Also make sure the frame data is cached so we don't waste memory.
- Handle PING/PONG and DISCONNECT messages from the server.



Possible UNIT Tests:
1. Create 4MB message then "send it" to multiple clients. Verify no additional memory usage.
